#### About me

I `m a Frontend developer in a large company, developing a project to automate the business processes of the organization. Despite my past experience as a React developer, I managed to master Angular pretty quickly, which is where the project is written.
My goals are: developing frontend development skills, improving the quality of writing code, sharing knowledge with like-minded people.
